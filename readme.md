# Internet Archive Analysis

This project was my capstone for the Python for Everbody course on Coursera. 

My primary goal was to learn how to use the Internet Archive's JSON API. 

So fare, I've done a very simplistic analysis, as seen in the `ia_analysis` Jupyter notebook. 

My next step is to expand that analysis.
